## Project Overview

This project applies microeconomic theory and quantitative analytics to a real-world corporate strategy problem: **how to allocate pricing and marketing resources efficiently when customer value is highly concentrated and demand responses vary across segments**.

Using the **Dunnhumby Complete Journey dataset** (2,500 households, 2.6M transactions over 711 days), the analysis integrates multiple analytical frameworks into a single, coherent decision-making system. Rather than treating pricing, promotions, segmentation, and retention as isolated exercises, the project models them jointly to support profit-maximizing strategy under realistic demand and behavioral constraints.

## Descripción del Proyecto

Este proyecto aplica teoría microeconómica y analítica cuantitativa a un problema real de estrategia corporativa: **cómo asignar recursos de pricing y marketing eficientemente cuando el valor del cliente está altamente concentrado y las respuestas de demanda varían entre segmentos**.

Usando el **dataset Dunnhumby Complete Journey** (2,500 hogares, 2.6M transacciones en 711 días), el análisis integra múltiples marcos analíticos en un sistema único y coherente de toma de decisiones. En lugar de tratar pricing, promociones, segmentación y retención como ejercicios aislados, el proyecto los modela conjuntamente para soportar estrategia de maximización de beneficios bajo restricciones realistas de demanda y comportamiento.

## Analytical Framework

The project is structured around five interconnected microeconomic workstreams, each answering a distinct strategic question while feeding into a unified corporate strategy:

### Customer Segmentation & Value Allocation

Households are segmented using **RFM metrics and K-means clustering** to identify heterogeneity in lifetime value. The analysis reveals a small group of Premium Loyalists generating a disproportionate share of revenue, alongside underpenetrated and at-risk segments.

**Key Insight**: This establishes the economic foundation for differentiated pricing and targeting strategies.

### Consumption Bundles & Cross-Selling

Using **market basket analysis (Apriori)**, the project identifies high-support product bundles with strong association strength. These bundles represent opportunities to increase basket size through non-price levers (assortment design and cross-aisle placement).

**Economic Framework**: Consistent with microeconomic substitution and complementarity effects.

### Price Elasticity & Promotional Effectiveness

Category-level **log-log demand regressions** estimate own-price elasticity and promotional lift. Results show predominantly inelastic demand, supporting selective price increases to protect margins.

**Finding**: Promotions are shown to be effective only when used strategically rather than broadly.

### Targeted Incentives & Coupon Optimization

A **logistic regression model** predicts coupon redemption propensity, enabling optimal targeting under budget constraints. The model demonstrates that a minority of households account for the majority of redemptions.

**Impact**: Allows firms to double campaign efficiency relative to untargeted promotions.

### Retention Dynamics & Time-to-Churn

Using **survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Cox models)**, the project identifies the behavioral drivers of customer survival. Only increases in trip frequency and spending intensity reduce churn risk.

**Critical Finding**: Incentives that fail to shift these behaviors do not generate long-term value.

## Strategic Insight

The integrated analysis shows that profit-maximizing retail strategy is not about maximizing discounts or reach, but about:

- **Protecting margins** where demand is inelastic
- **Using promotions** only when they trigger incremental behavior
- **Allocating incentives** toward high-propensity, high-ROI households
- **Designing bundles and experiences** that increase trips and basket size

The final output is an actionable corporate strategy playbook, translating microeconomic insights into concrete pricing, promotion, and retention decisions, including a **90-day execution roadmap** and capital allocation framework.

## Key Takeaways

### Customer Concentration
A small customer segment drives the majority of revenue, justifying differentiated treatment

### Price Optimization
Most categories tolerate moderate price increases without volume loss

### Bundling Strategy
Bundling and cross-selling outperform blanket discounting

### Targeting Efficiency
Targeted incentives outperform mass promotions by a wide margin

### Long-Term Value Creation
Long-term value is driven by behavioral change, not one-off incentives
